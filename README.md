# Batman Wordcloud
   - We'll create a Wordcloud based on the script of the movie 'Batman' with Python

**_Step 1 - Import libraries_**
   - We'll import some python libraries like WordCloud, matplotlib.pyplot, PIL and numpy for the ceation of our wordcloud.

**_Step 2 - Open text script of batman_**
   - Next, we'll open our text script 'batman.txt' having more than 10,000 words in it which is completely based on the movie 'Batman'.
      - ***Text Script*** - [batman.txt](https://github.com/RawatMeghna/blob/main/Batman_Wordcloud/batman.txt)
      
**_Step 3 - Set the appearance of wordcloud_**
   - Now, we'll open our batman png image using numpy library and also set the appearance of the wordcloud like colour, contour, etc.

**_Step 4 - Creation of wordcloud_**
   - In this step, we'll create our wordcloud by combining our image and text script according to the appearance we have set.  

**_Step 5 - Plot the wordcloud_**
   - Last step involves plotting the wordcloud using matplotlib library.

**_Step 6 - Save the generated wordcloud_**
   - Eventually, we'll save our generated wordcloud to our pc or device in the png format.

**Other examples**
   - Here are some other images I've experimented on and turned them into wordcloud.
